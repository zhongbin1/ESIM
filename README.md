# ESIM
Tensorflow implementation of ESIM model presented in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06038) Enhanced LSTM for Natural Language Inference

## Implement details

**mask**: The calculation of attention weights and  pooling layer should mask the padding words.

**num_classes**: For simpliticy, we set the number of label classes as 2. Of cause, you can change it to satisfy your own data.
